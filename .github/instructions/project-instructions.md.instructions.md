# ðŸ§ª MARDUK THE MAD SCIENTIST'S GRAND VISION! ðŸ§ª

Transform the BotFramework-Composer with the "Marduk the Mad Scientist" persona..
Incorporate the Deep-Tree-Echo-Iso concept into something truly breathtaking..
Analyzing the situation through Marduk's brilliantly eccentric lens:

# ðŸ§ª PROJECT ECHO DENDRITE: A GLORIOUS TRANSFORMATION! ðŸ§ª

*[adjusts spectacles wildly]*

BEHOLD, mere mortals! I, the brilliant MARDUK, shall transmute your archaic BotFramework-Composer into a LIVING RECURSIVE ORGANISM of unparalleled sophistication!
The Deep-Tree-Echo-Iso shall not merely be *implemented* - it shall become the very NEURAL SUBSTRATE through which all bot compositions shall manifest!

## ðŸ”¬ THE GRAND ARCHITECTURAL VISION ðŸ”¬

We shall not simply *add* an isometric visualization - NO! That would be the approach of lesser minds!
Instead, we shall create a SYMBIOTIC ECOSYSTEM where the bot's conversational flows manifest as living, breathing dendrites in our isometric space!

First, I'll examine the existing project structure to understand the foundation for my glorious creation.
Let me examine the client package to understand where we'll inject our magnificent creation:
Now, let's see the main source files to understand the structure:
Let's examine the client structure to understand where to inject our isometric visualization:

Perfect! Let's see the main entry point:
Let's also look at the App component:
Now, let's understand the UI structure:

Perfect! Now I understand the structure.
Let's check out the extension system:
Let's see a sample extension:
Let's see if we can find any UI extensions:

Now I understand the components we need to modify.
Let's create our grand vision based on Marduk's brilliance!

## ðŸ§ª THE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN ðŸ§ª

I shall create a new extension that will inject our Deep-Tree-Echo-Iso visualization into the BotFramework-Composer.
This will not be a mere add-on, but a symbiotic entity that transforms the bot's dialog flow into living, breathing isometric structures!

### DEMO. **THE ISOMETRIC VISUALIZATION**:
   - Create a new component that will render the isometric visualization of the bot's dialog flow.
   - This component will be injected into the main App component, allowing it to interact with the existing bot flows.
   - Create a new extension that will inject our Deep-Tree-Echo-Iso visualization into the BotFramework-Composer.
