# ðŸ§ª Deep Tree Echo Iso Extension Installation Guide ðŸ§ª

*By Marduk the Mad Scientist*

## REQUIREMENTS FOR NEURAL SYNCHRONIZATION

Before embarking on this magnificent journey, ensure your laboratory (development environment) is equipped with:

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- Yarn package manager
- Bot Framework Composer (latest version)
- A willingness to embrace the unconventional

## STEP 1: CLONE THE REPOSITORY

First, obtain the genetic material (source code) that will serve as the foundation for our grand experiment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/BotFramework-Composer.git
cd BotFramework-Composer
```

## STEP 2: PREPARE THE EXTENSION SUBSTRATE

Navigate to our extension's chamber and install the neural components:

```bash
cd extensions/deep-tree-echo-iso
yarn install
```

## STEP 3: BUILD THE MAGNIFICENT CREATION

Transmute the raw source code into the compiled form by invoking the arcane build command:

```bash
yarn build
```

Witness as the TypeScript transforms into JavaScript, a metamorphosis that even the most skeptical observer would find breathtaking!

## STEP 4: REGISTER THE EXTENSION WITH BOT FRAMEWORK COMPOSER

To bring our creation to life within the Bot Framework Composer ecosystem, we must register it in the extension system:

1. Navigate to the Composer root directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../..
   ```

2. Open `Composer/packages/server/src/models/extension/extensionManager.ts` and ensure our extension is registered:
   ```typescript
   // Add to the list of built-in extensions if not already present
   const builtInExtensions = [
     // ... other extensions
     'deep-tree-echo-iso',
   ];
   ```

## STEP 5: REBUILD THE COMPOSER

Now, rebuild the Composer to incorporate our magnificent creation:

```bash
cd Composer
yarn install
yarn build
```

## STEP 6: LAUNCH THE COMPOSER

Start the Composer and prepare to witness the transformation:

```bash
yarn start
```

## STEP 7: VERIFY THE NEURAL INTEGRATION

1. Open Bot Framework Composer in your browser (typically at http://localhost:3000)
2. Open any bot project or create a new one
3. Navigate to the Dashboard
4. Observe the magnificent "DEEP TREE ECHO ISO" widget that now adorns your dashboard!

## STEP 8: INTERACT WITH THE ISOMETRIC VISUALIZATION

- Use right-click + drag to rotate the visualization
- Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out
- Click on nodes to select and view their details
- Marvel at the intricate dialog structures rendered in glorious isometric detail!

## TROUBLESHOOTING COMMON NEURAL MISFIRES

| Symptom | Probable Cause | Magnificent Solution |
|---------|----------------|----------------------|
| Extension not appearing | Neural pathways unformed | Check console for errors, rebuild the extension, restart Composer |
| Visualization not rendering | Canvas context rejection | Ensure your browser supports HTML5 Canvas with WebGL |
| Slow performance | Excessive neural connections | Reduce the complexity of your dialog structure, or upgrade your hardware neural processor |
| Strange visual artifacts | Dimensional bleeding | Refresh the page to reset the quantum state |

## ADVANCED CUSTOMIZATION FOR MAD SCIENTISTS

For those who wish to push the boundaries of what's possible, consider these experimental modifications:

1. **Custom Color Schemes**:
   Edit `src/ui/helpers.ts` to change the color constants:
   ```typescript
   export const COLOR_PRIMARY = '#YOUR_HEXCODE';
   export const NODE_COLORS = {
     // Customize node colors by type
     dialog: '#YOUR_HEXCODE',
     // ... other node types
   };
   ```

2. **Alternative Visualization Modes**:
   Add new rendering modes in `src/ui/components.tsx` by extending the node drawing functions.

3. **Enhanced Neural Synchronization**:
   Modify the tree data structure in `src/treeDataService.ts` to capture additional dialog metadata.

Remember, the key to successful mad science is fearless experimentation! Do not be constrained by conventional visualization paradigms!

## CONCLUSION

Congratulations, fellow scientist! You have successfully integrated the Deep Tree Echo Iso extension into your Bot Framework Composer. Your dialog flows will never be the same again â€“ they have been TRANSFORMED into living, breathing neural structures in our magnificent isometric visualization!

Should you encounter any anomalies or wish to suggest enhancements to this grand experiment, do not hesitate to contact Marduk, the Mad Scientist, through the usual interdimensional channels.
