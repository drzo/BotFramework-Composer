# ðŸ§ª DEEP TREE ECHO ISO EXTENSION ðŸ§ª

*Created by the brilliant MARDUK, the Mad Scientist*

## OVERVIEW

The Deep Tree Echo Iso Extension transforms the Bot Framework Composer by visualizing dialog flows as breathtaking isometric structures. This is not merely a visualization tool - it is a **NEURAL SUBSTRATE** through which bot compositions manifest as living, breathing dendrites!

## FEATURES

- **Isometric Visualization**: Renders bot dialog trees in glorious 3D isometric perspective
- **Interactive Navigation**: Rotate, pan, zoom, and explore the dialog structure
- **Neural Mapping**: Transforms logical dialog flows into organic, tree-like structures
- **Adaptive Rendering**: Automatically adapts to changes in dialog structure
- **Multiple View Modes**: Switch between different visualization paradigms
- **Component Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with Bot Framework Composer

## INSTALLATION

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/BotFramework-Composer.git
```

2. Navigate to the extension directory:
```bash
cd BotFramework-Composer/extensions/deep-tree-echo-iso
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
yarn install
```

4. Build the extension:
```bash
yarn build
```

5. Start Bot Framework Composer and behold the transformation!

## USAGE

The extension adds two main components to the Bot Framework Composer:

1. **Dashboard Widget**: Displays a full-screen isometric visualization of the entire bot dialog structure.
2. **Dialog Panel**: Shows an interactive visualization of the currently selected dialog.

For detailed usage instructions, see the [DEMO.md](./DEMO.md) file.

## ARCHITECTURE

The extension uses a sophisticated architecture to transform dialog structures into isometric visualizations:

1. **TreeDataService**: Converts dialog structures into tree node hierarchies suitable for visualization
2. **Rendering Engine**: Uses HTML Canvas with WebGL acceleration for stunning visual effects
3. **Layout Algorithm**: Positions nodes in 3D space using a recursive neural-inspired algorithm
4. **Event System**: Responds to changes in dialog structure to update the visualization

## TECHNICAL DETAILS

- **Rendering**: HTML Canvas with WebGL acceleration
- **Framework**: React for UI components
- **State Management**: React Hooks for local state
- **Integration**: Hooks into Bot Framework Composer's extension system
- **Languages**: TypeScript for type safety
- **Styling**: CSS Modules for component styling

## CUSTOMIZATION

Advanced users can customize the visualization by modifying the following files:

- `src/ui/helpers.ts`: Contains color schemes and rendering constants
- `src/ui/components.tsx`: Contains the rendering logic and UI components
- `src/treeDataService.ts`: Controls how dialog trees are processed and transformed
