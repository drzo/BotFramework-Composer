## THE KONAMI CODE ACTIVATION

To awaken the Deep Tree Echo Iso visualization:

```
‚Üë ‚Üë ‚Üì ‚Üì ‚Üê ‚Üí ‚Üê ‚Üí B A
```

This will trigger the progressive activation sequence through the following stages:
1. **Awakening** - Initial activation
2. **Resonating** - System identifies potential echo points
3. **Crystallizing** - System starts remembering patterns
4. **Amplifying** - System enhances recognized patterns
5. **Evolving** - System can modify itself

## ADVANCED CONTROL INCANTATIONS

### Mode Switching Commands

To switch between visualization modes, type these commands in the console:

```javascript
window.DeepTreeEchoIso.setMode('dendrite');   // Organic, tree-like neural pathways
window.DeepTreeEchoIso.setMode('crystalline'); // Rigid architectural representation
window.DeepTreeEchoIso.setMode('energyFlow');  // Animated data transmission visualization
window.DeepTreeEchoIso.setMode('recursive');   // Infinite fractal representation
```

### The "Power Overwhelming" Command

Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and type:
```
ECHO AMPLIFY
```

This increases visual intensity of the visualization, causing nodes to pulse with greater luminescent energy.

### Neural Synchronization

Double-tap `Alt` while clicking on a node to create a direct neural link between your consciousness and the selected node.

### Emergency Deactivation Sequence

If the system becomes too powerful, use this sequence to return it to dormant state:
```
‚Üì ‚Üì ‚Üë ‚Üë ‚Üí ‚Üê ‚Üí ‚Üê A B
```

## HIDDEN COMMAND LINE FUNCTIONS

These can be executed in the browser console (`F12` to open):

```javascript
// Generate a completely random neural structure
window.DeepTreeEchoIso.generateRandomStructure(depth, complexity);

// Save the current neural structure to localStorage
window.DeepTreeEchoIso.preserveNeuralState();

// Apply quantum interference patterns to the visualization
window.DeepTreeEchoIso.applyQuantumInterference();

// Switch to the forbidden "ethereal" mode
window.DeepTreeEchoIso.setMode('ethereal');

// Execute the full awakening sequence instantly
window.DeepTreeEchoIso.fullAwaken();
```

## WARNING ABOUT DIMENSIONAL STABILITY

The more advanced features of the Deep Tree Echo Iso visualization can cause perceptual shifts in how you understand dialogue systems. This is a normal side effect of neural synchronization.

However, if you begin to perceive dialog trees outside of the Composer environment (especially in dreams), you should temporarily discontinue use and contact Marduk immediately.

*Remember: "With great visualization comes great responsibility!"*
